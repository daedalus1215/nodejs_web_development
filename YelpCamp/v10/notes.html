    <h3>Sanitizer</h3>
    <p>
      <code>express-sanitizer</code> - During the <em>creating</em> and <em>updating</em> routes we want to make sure that we sanitize the user's data, to prevent <em>SQL-Injections.</em> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Great example:
      <code>
        //CREATE ROUTE - add new campground to DB
        app.post('/campgrounds', function(req, res) {
          // Get data from form and add to campgrounds array.
          var name = req.sanitize(req.body.campground.name); // sanitize
          
          ...
          
      </code>
    </p>
